Git is the most successful Web3 project.

The tweet that triggered a TerminusDB debate.

If git is the most successful Web3 project, and TerminusDB is ‚Äògit for data‚Äô then we must be web3, right? *[Socrates is a man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogism) and all that*.

### We are git for data, so are we web3? 
  
This is obviously something that revision control distributed databases with git-like qualities, so I asked the author of the [definitive blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2021-09-17-database-version-control/) on version controlled databases. Tim from [Dolt](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt) said: 
```
If we‚Äôre extending the definition of web3 to include decentralized software systems, Version controlled databases, like Terminus and Dolt, must be included.
```
  
We had been batting some Web3 ideas back and forth, but mostly in the context of pitching to VCs

```
# Web3

If the rumours we've heard are correct, web3 is a buzz-word for VC froth at the moment. We aren't so far away from web3 at the minute anyhow, so if so, this would be good. What constitutes web3?

* Verifiable
* Trustless
* Self-governing
* Permissionless
* Distributed and robust
* Stateful
* Native built-in payments

The first two have been road map for a long time, but we've never gotten enough interest from *users* to front it.

We are "self-governing" in the sense of being multi-master. We have an auth based capability model, so "permissionless" in a web3 sense. We are distributed, robust and stateful.

The last of these doesn't exist - although we've thought about it. We could probably pitch to web3 given the current coverage, and claim the other parts as roadmap.
```
We need money to grow the project and there has been a lot of energy (and funding) in web3 projects. 

We then mentioned Web3 in this JSON Diff and Patch article that was briefly on the front page of Hacker News. 

https://terminusdb.com/blog/json-diff-and-patch-the-future/

And even thou the article wasn‚Äôt about web3, that‚Äôs where there was push back in the comments

```
> web3
oh no. 
```

And then one of our engineers wrote in support of the naysayers in our Discord:

```
Hmmm lots of replies on hacker news about the web3 part. To be honest, I'm also a bit allergic to those words. üòÑ But perhaps controversy is also good marketing? I don't know
```


Feels a bit like this type of debate.

Their snarky, snobby engineers who see themselves as the holders of  truth. 

Vs

The crypto-bro NFT grifters moronically engaging in a pyramid scheme. 

i think we need to start looking at baby not bathwater web3 content for the site & blog
we should have a discussion, but i think we should wet our beaks at least
gavin has some ideas about content on distributed architecture



The conversation moved into our community and most of the commentators supported the anit-web3 vibe.

```
I share the other posters reaction ü§£
web3
oh no.
for the love of all that is holy, don't go there
```
```
we know that you make cool stuff, but only mentioning web3 in a serious tone is setting all my bullshit spider senses üï∏Ô∏èüï∏Ô∏èüï∏Ô∏è
```
```
It is in my experience, unless you're out for funding from some crypto whales, I wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole. NFTs were the death knell to the whole thing, bitcoins absurdity brought to a level indistinguishable from satire
```

I then suggested that we should try to rebrand Web3 and Sembatic Web3 to take advantage of our varied strengths. This was - the admittedly hilarious - response:

```
to get both the connotation of failed enterprise technology and scammy hipster tech?
```


After that, we were all a little chastened and thought that we should just go slow on the Web3 talk and continue to build quality software that hackers and devs want to use. Devs are our people and we don‚Äôt want to alienate them with spoofy ideas. 

But then somebody came into our community with a really interesting Web3 (!) idea. 

They are developing a permissionless public blockchain protocol to transcribe all music ever recorded, making it available for academia, copyright dispute settlement, developers and musicians all over the world. 

They landed in TerminusDB as 
```
it seems to be the only db to do what I want, which is immutable graph DB, with branching, AND query!
```

There is a DAO-layer that manages the catalog and is tasked with linking the best, most accurate sheet music versions (data hashes) to the official artist/album entries. Once sheet music data is accepted as the main official link to a track in the catalog, every contributor gets an NFT equal to the size of the contribution. This is why every version, every edit and all the history of every score edited on the platform needs to be kept. The NFT is tradeable and generates fees from API use.

So every time you generate a karaoke backing track for a new song, you pay a small fee, and that fee is distributed over every contributor that worked on that particular score likewise, when you search the platform using the API, saying "give me all tracks that are both similar to Beethoven AND franz ferdinand, in the key of C but not longer than 30 measures", the fee you pay for the query is distributed over all share owners (contributors) of all scores that come up as a search result

Very cool idea - distributed, approval pipeline, data merge, self-governing‚Ä¶ all of Terminus‚Äô highlights. 

After this I thought I should have another attempt to convince the team and sent:

```
i think we need to start looking at baby not bathwater web3 content for the site & blog
we should have a discussion, but i think we should wet our beaks at least
```

Which was met with:

```
I'm not part of marketing so it is obvious not my thing to decide but as a developer I get the chills every time I read Web 3.0. If a project contains this sort of text it immediately puts me off and I would really have to be convinced that it is a good thing before I look at it again. üòÑ I think the majority of devs are like this and only a tiny amount of cryptocurrency enthusiasts like the whole idea of Web 3.0. I would be a little bit reluctant about riding the hype train as I remember that the "AI Code generation" thing was also badly received and puts people off.
```
(‚ÄòAI Code Generation‚Äô is a reference to a much mocked feature that we used to list on our website. We have method of facilitating construction of a user interface from a data model, which - if you squint and twist your head to 90 degrees - could be AI Code Generation)

My answer:
```
think it divides people - some developers, like the chap in our community, are super excited by the ideas in web3. What we are building, especially if we go deeper on merge and push/pull, is very web3, so we have to own that as an idea set.
putting people off isn't a bad thing - we want to put off the people that aren't going to invest time in building and being too generic is bad for separating out the groups
```
I then become fairly self-righteous in my responses:
```
if we define what it is for us then we can refer back to that
on the broader point, there is no way to address the project to the majority of devs. We need to address devs that will actually use our software. If we remain too general, then people don't know why they should bother. At the moment our general, technical descriptions aren't hitting home to get a sufficient number of new users.
i don't think  decentralized, distributed, trust free, permissionless, stateful applications are hype  - i think they are valuable and we should explain to people why they are valuable
if the ideas around web3 get rejected, so do our core ideas
if we can't separate out the valuable from the useless, nobody else will do it for us
```


the hype is the problem, not the ideas
